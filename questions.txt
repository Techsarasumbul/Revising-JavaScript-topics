Given a number n, If the number is divisible by 6 then print Divisible else Not divisible.
Input Format
First line contains an integer.
Output Format
If the number is divisible by 6 then Divisible will be printed. If the number is not divisible by 6 then Not divisible will be printed.


Take two positive integers from the user. Verify if (a+b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2.
Calculate the Left hand side (LHS) and the right hand side (RHS) of the equation. Print the (LHS) and the (RHS).
Print VERIFIED in uppercase if they are equal, otherwise print NOT VERIFIED.
Input Format
The first line contains two integers A and B.
Output Format
Print two integers, the LHS and RHS in separate lines.
Then print "VERIFIED" (without quotes and in uppercase) if they are equal, else print "NOT VERIFIED".



You are given a number. Your task is to find the sum of all the digits in the number.
Input Format
The only line of input contains a number.
Output Format
Print the sum of digits of the given number.
Example 1
Input
1873
Output
19
Explanatio
1+8+7+3 = 19. Hence the output should be 19.
Example 2
Input
80923
Output
22



Write a program that inputs a positive integer N. It should then output a message indicating whether the number is a prime number or not.

Input Format
A single line containing the integer N

Output Format
Print a string, either "N is a prime number" or "N is not a prime number" (without quotes), depending on whether N is prime or not.

Example 1
Input

5
Output

5 is a prime number






Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number with the digits reversed.

For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 54321.

Note: Input number will not have any trailing zeros.

Input Format
The first line of input contains the integer n.

Output Format
The output should be the reverse of n.

Example 1
Input

12345
Output:

54321




Given two number a and b, find their HCF.

What Is HCF?

HCF or Highest Common Factor is the greatest common divisor between two numbers.

Input Format
The first line of input contains the integers a and b.

Output Format
The output should be the hcf of a and b.

Example 1
Input

75 90
Output:

15
Explanation

75 = 3 * 5 * 5 and 90 = 2 * 3 * 3 * 5. So the common factors are 3*5 = 15.
